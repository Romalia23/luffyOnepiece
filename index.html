    <h1>Monkey D. Luffy</h1>
    <section id="aboutme">
      <p>Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat",is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.He pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragonand grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garpand as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan,under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.</p>

      <p>Gear 2 was first seen on Enies Lobby. Luffy increases the speed of his blood flow, and thanks to the rubber nature of his blood vessels and organs, his body can withstand the pressure. This allows more oxygen and nutrients to be pumped throughout through his body. Gear 2 greatly increases Luffy's physical capabilities, allowing him to easily surpass the movement speed of Soru users and smash through the defensive power of Tekkai.</p>
      <p>Gear 3 was first seen on Enies Lobby. By blowing a massive amount of air into his thumb, Luffy can inflate the bones of a particular part of his body, making it gigantic. These inflated body parts are capable of inflicting damage on a massive scale, being able to destroy steel doors and large buildings with ease,[119] and Gear 3's power became magnified when Luffy learned to use Armament Haki during the timeskip, and Supreme King Haki infusion during the Wano Country Arc.</p>
      <p>Gear 4 was created during Luffy's two-year training on Rusukaina and was first seen on Dressrosa. By blowing into his arm, Luffy inflates the muscles in his entire body and covers it with Armament Haki, taking one of three forms. The first form, Boundman, makes his composition akin to a rubber ball, causing him to bounce all the time. Luffy is capable of retracting his arms and legs inside of his body, unleashing blows of devastating power, as well as being able to change the direction of his attacks. His defense also increases, with most attacks bouncing off his body.</p>
      <p>Gear 5 was created during the climax of the Raid on Onigashima, as a result of Luffy awakening his Devil Fruit for the first time since the Void Century.[126]

After awakening, Luffy gains increased physical power and even greater freedom while demonstrating many new abilities, such as being able to freely manipulate the shape and size of his body; instead of focusing more on hardening himself using Armament Haki, he takes on a more cartoonish fighting style, as well as being able to grant the environment around him the same properties as rubber, which allowed him to deflect a Bolo Breath by bouncing it back at Kaidou, as well as being able to stretch objects he touches like rubber, including living things and even lightning. As pointed out by Kaidou, Luffy's power now has the characteristics of both Paramecia and Zoan.[127]</p>
